## About the current release
This is just the first beta of Customiser. We have lots of ideas for the future and we'd love to hear your ideas, too! Feel free to post issues and fork the code. 

## How to get the code up and running
All you'll need to do with the code is add the location of a web proxy and an ArcGIS App ID. 
Both of these go in *assets\js\oauth.js*
